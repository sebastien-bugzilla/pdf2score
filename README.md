# pdf2score
This program aim at helping lilypond user to transcript score from pdf format to lilypond files. It use OpenCV2 (http://opencv.org/) pattern recognition to detect lines, notes. Then the data are analysed to guess a rough lilypond transcription in ly file which need to be corrected before compilation. At the moment it is in development and not ready for use.
Check the example to see the type of results I've obtained.

Any suggestion is welcome.
